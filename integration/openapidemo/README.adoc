= OpenApi Example

This example consists of a client that requests data from a server. Both server and client share the same OpenAPI specification as contract.

- The server generates the interface from the OpenAPI spec.
- The client generates the client-implementation from it.

=== To try it out,

1. Start the server -> link:./server/README[Server Readme]

2. Start the client -> link:./client/README[Client Readme]

The client will request data from the server and log it in the console.
